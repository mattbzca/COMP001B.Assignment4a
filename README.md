Purpose: This is the 4th assignment focusing on using colors effectively by making a mock-up company product launch page. My inspiration for this page would be McDonald's as there's an available public styling page guide, an existing media library, and an existing company page:

https://www.mcdonalds.cz/static/files/logo/mcdonalds_logomanual.pdf

https://corporate.mcdonalds.com/corpmcd/our-stories/media-assets-library.html

https://www.mcdonalds.com/us/en-us.html

The mock-up styling will be different from McDonald's current website, but will synthesize the public styling page guide with some features from McDonald's current format with their food menu.

For example, the fonts used would be the Speedee fonts, which are the universal fonts for all McDonald's pages. It also makes suggestions to use the arch logo only with the color schemes.
